# Method for Lichen Cover and Bark Thickness Estimation

This is a still on going project. Purpose of this project is to extract data from photographs to be used in further anaylsis.
I work with University of Jyväskylä, Ecology and Environmental Sciences Department.

There are 4 main methods in this project:

	* Crop images using Segment Anything Model by Meta
	* Normalise images using background blanket
	* Estimate lichen cover using HSV color space
	* Estimate bark thickness
